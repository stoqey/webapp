<p>
  PS: To avoid your SELL orders from being stuck/idle from the order book,
  please submit your order with a slightly lower price than the current market
  price (orders in "ASK" section), let's say if 1 share is at $102 like in the first
  image above, but the top order in "ASK" sections is $99, so we submit our order
  at $98 so that the system prioritizes your order first!
