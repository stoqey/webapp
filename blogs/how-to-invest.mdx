<p>
  PS: To avoid your orders from being stuck/idle from the order book, please
  submit your order with a slightly higher price than the current market price, let's
  say if 1 share is at $6, submit your buy order at $6.10 so that the system
  prioritizes your order first! (this is not in any way investment advice. please invest wisely)!
