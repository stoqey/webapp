            <strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically: </strong> <br />
            <p>
                As is true of many digital platforms, we collect certain personal information automatically when
                you visit our online services, including:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location Data</strong> <br />
                    To help us protect against fraud, provide our services to you, and improve our services, we
                    collect location data, including current and historical information concerning a user’s
                    geographic location, GPS location, transaction location, and IP addresses that they use in
                    conjunction with our Services. We collect your precise location data with your permission,
                    and use that information, for example, to help protect against fraud by detecting and
                    declining debit card transactions that may occur far away from your device’s location. We
                    collect information about your location through GPS, Wi-Fi, wireless network
                    triangulation, or other methods in order to obtain your location. We may also approximate
                    your location by your IP Address. We also use the Google Maps API to gather information
                    about your location. Google uses various technologies to determine your location,
                    including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Google with
                    information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers (see Google’s Privacy
                    Policy to learn more).

                    <strong>Usage and Device Data Collected Automatically Through Tracking Technologies</strong> <br />
                    To provide a personalized and enhanced user experience, we, and our third-party
                    partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit or use our
                    Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this
                    information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects,
                    web beacons, embedded scripts, location identifying technologies, file information, and
                    similar technology (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”). For example, we collect
                    information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type,
                    Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time
                    stamp, a unique ID (that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or
                    your account), and other similar information. We use Tracking Technologies to help ensure
                    that you have a high-quality experience on our Services. We also use Tracking
                    Technologies to aid in the targeted advertising of our services on other platforms. From
                    your device manufacturer, we also may collect the names of other third-party applications
                    that you have downloaded on your device.

                If you prefer, you can change your cookie settings. Some browsers have options that allow the
                user to control whether the browser will accept cookies, reject cookies, or notify the user each
                time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting your settings, but doing so will
                limit the range of features available to you on our Services and other websites. Be sure to read
                any information provided by your browser developer to understand the limitations of these
                settings, as they may differ from browser to browser and may not apply to all technologies.
                You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain
                technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email, used our
                Services, or performed certain functions with it.

                Our Services also occasionally use “local shared objects” (also known as “Flash cookies”). Like
                browser cookies, Flash cookies may be used for coordinating content delivery, website
                functionality, maintaining preferences, advertising, or analytics. Unlike browser cookies, “Flash
                cookies” are not stored in the browser. You may be able to manage these Flash cookies by visiting

                <strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms </strong> . Some web browsers transmit “do-not-track”
            signals to websites. We currently don’t take action in response to these signals.
