        We participate in interest-based advertising and use third-party advertising companies to serve
        you targeted advertisements based on your online browsing history and your interests. As a
        self-directed broker-dealer, we do not advertise on behalf of specific securities or investment
        options on our Services. We permit third-party online advertising networks, social media
        companies, and other third-party services to collect information about your use of our Services
        over time so that they may play or display ads on other websites, apps, or services you may use,
        and on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information used for
        interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. For
        advertising, we may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) or
        hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We and
        our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online on other
        platforms more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such
        as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.

        We’re not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties, and the information
        practices of these third parties are not covered by this Policy. Some of these companies are
        members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad
        targeting from member companies. To learn more, please visit
        http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices or the DAA’s resources, available at

        you of cookies by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please note
        that some advertising opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies.
        Furthermore, if you use a different device, change browsers, or delete the opt-out cookies, you
        may need to perform the opt-out task again. You may also be able to limit certain interest-based
        mobile advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting “limit ad tracking”
        (iOS) or “opt out of interest based ads” (Android).

          Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager
